# To-Do-List App

Click [here](https://tommy7808.github.io/To-Do-List/) to run the app.

## Project Description
This is a quick javascript app on a to do list. You can **add**, **edit** and **delete** tasks. I created this app so I could apply the knowledge I've learned so far from a [javascript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp) that I am currently doing.
